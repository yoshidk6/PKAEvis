Correct orders of lines when overlayed
- Maybe manually draw AE lines for each category?
-- This also allows to change PK curve color with dose (not possible to have two color scales in ggplot2)

Create `clean.AE.days` function?
- Overwrite lower AE grades with upper AE grade
- Clean sometimes untidy AE data

Censoring for PK plot (especially for placebo group)

Create example AE data (not manually written table file)
